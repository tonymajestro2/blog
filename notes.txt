To Do:
--------
- clean up rendering code for main page login, front page
    - clean up render functions (too many, change method names)

- clean up markup, css rules, html divs

- front page:
    - maybe links to recent posts on side bar?

- client-side register form validation
    
- ** Add https to login pages **
    - consider using two session cookies;
        - one for accessing non-secure pages
        - a 'secure' cookie that only gets transmitted when the user
          accesses a secure page through HTTPS.  This will prevent
          sniffing the secure session token

- Add public/private functionality
    - add option to register page
    - think about how urls should work for private/public pages

- Add account info page
    - change password
    - change email
    - change account visibility (private, public)
    



Handlers:
---------
- /: mainpage
- /[name]: handler for [name]'s frontpage of blog
- /[name]/[post_num]: handler for the specific post for the user

Mainpage:
---------
- masthead
- login button
- register button

User frontpage:
--------------
- username/nickname
- list of 10 most recent posts
    - each post has button to take you to specific post
- show more posts button

Misc:
-----
- need blog name
- ideas for styling
